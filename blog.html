        <h2> Throwback: Ep.63 #Disunomics - The Housing Market, Land Value tax and Grenfell</h2>
        <p> Last year, joined by economics graduate turned investment banker David Belle, Disunomics broke down the economic and social philosophy of Georgism, otherwise known as the ‘single tax’. Considering the current political climate within the UK, I thought I’d revisit this episode and explore the way in which Georgism could solve the housing crisis. Georgism posits that global justice requires that the benefits of nature be equally and globally shared. Henry George was born in Philadelphia in 1837. He settled in San Francisco, where he became a printer. His first book was Our Land and Land Policy (1871), in which he told the history of land ownership in the USA, showing how much of the land was obtained at little or no price by land speculators, often dishonestly. <a class="readmoreclick" href="./blog-post.html">Read more</a></p>

        <h2>Podcasting, For Us By Us</h2>
        <p> A podcast is a free audio story, you can listen to anywhere and any time by downloading or streaming it on various platforms. The term itself was coined by technologist Ben Hammersley, as a portmanteau of “iPod” and broadcast. Over the years, we have seen the proliferation of this audio and increasingly visual content on the internet. Podcasting has always had a political spirit, motivated by a belief in the internets ability to democratise speech and circumvent gatekeepers. There are different types of podcasts, comedy, sex & relationships, sports, political commentary, business and sometimes they just tell a story - fact or fiction. In January 2013, comedy and pop culture podcast ‘The Read’, widely held as the pioneer of black podcasting, premiered. As of 2019, it has amassed 85 millions streams worldwide and receives 1.5 million unique listens each week. <a class="readmoreclick" href="./index.html">Read more</a></p>

        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
